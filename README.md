#Dotfiles

Simple repo with my dotfiles, `zshrc` in parts is more than six years old, so if your looking for intersting stuff you should look there first.

`vimrc`, `screenrc` and `gitconfig` are fairly simple, but do their job on my machine(s).

#Scripts

Small part of scripts I've written over the years, these are the ones worth sharing (I think):

* `clean-my-mac` - I run it once a month to regain some space and cleanup my mac
* `pushover-terminl` - simple script to send pushover messages from terminal, extremly helpful on remote hosts and long jobs in screen
* `setup-osx` - mostly stolen from https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx
* `sleepwatcher-*` - scripts I use with [sleepwatcher daemon](http://www.bernhard-baehr.de)
* `system-stats` - simple one line system info, I used to have it at the end of my `zshrc`
